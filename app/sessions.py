"""Durable per-session storage for batched operation submission.

A session pins the shared initial document and initial version vector and
accumulates every accepted batch into one cumulative operation log.  Both
reads and batch commits re-run the ordinary merge rules *from the initial
document* over the whole log -- the previous result is never used as a new
baseline -- so late-arriving concurrent writes still take part in the
original arbitration and conflict accounting, and a batch may causally
reference operations stored by earlier batches.

Every commit that contributes new operations also appends an immutable
**history boundary**: the merged document at the new revision.  Boundary
``h`` is the document of revision ``h``, so the events of revision ``r``
are the snapshot diff from boundary ``r-1`` to boundary ``r`` -- exactly
what ``POST /route-changes`` would compute between the two documents.
Boundaries are persisted in the same atomic write as the revision (inside
the same cross-process locked section), so an incremental reader can page
through committed revisions after a restart.  Retransmissions, stale
``expected_revision`` submissions and invalid batches add no history.

Late-arriving concurrent edits change the *current* merge result but can
never rewrite a previously committed boundary: a boundary stores the
document snapshot that was current at commit time, not a pointer into a
later recomputation.

Sessions written by older versions of the service have no history
boundaries.  On the first access (any read, or the first successful
commit) of such a legacy record the boundary history is seeded with one
entry: the currently visible merged document at the session's current
revision.  That revision becomes the session's history origin: cursors
before it, or past the current revision, are rejected (422 at the HTTP
layer).

Batch commits are atomic: validation, recomputation and the revision bump
happen inside a critical section guarded by an in-process lock *and* a
per-session ``flock`` file (``.{session_id}.lock`` next to the session
file), and the record is re-read from disk inside that section.  The
guarantee therefore holds not only between threads of one process but
also between several service processes sharing ``SESSION_STORE_DIR``:
two concurrent submissions carrying the same expected revision cannot
both succeed -- the loser observes the bumped revision and gets a
conflict.  The updated session is written to disk (temp file +
``os.replace``) before the lock is released, and reads always come
straight from disk (never from a per-process cache), so every process
immediately sees the latest committed revision.

JSONPath replacement commits (``replace_paths``) reuse the same critical
section: the restricted-JSONPath selection is evaluated there against the
locked revision's recomputed document, so selected paths can never belong
to a stale revision; the generated per-actor contiguous ``set`` run and
the revision check, recomputation, boundary append and persist then act
as one commit.  Over-limit (>20 matches) or ancestor/descendant match
sets, malformed expressions and query-budget overruns reject before
anything is written; a zero-hit query is a success that stores no
operation, bumps no revision and appends no boundary.

A session may pin up to ``PROTECTED_PATHS_LIMIT`` distinct, valid
RFC 6901 JSON Pointers at creation.  The rule is part of the durable
record, immutable for the session's whole lifetime and shared with every
process reading the directory; records written before the feature exist
read the empty rule.  Both commit paths compare every protected
location's resolved value between the locked revision's document and the
would-be document *inside the critical section*, before the record is
mutated or persisted: a set changing the value (explicit ``null`` vs
missing included; booleans never equal numbers), an ancestor subtree
replacement, an array insert/delete shifting a protected index, or any
visible change under a protected root rejects the whole request as
``ProtectedPathError`` (HTTP 422) -- no log entry, revision bump, history
boundary or legacy-origin migration is written.  Writing the protected
location with its current value still stores the operation and bumps
the revision, and exact retransmissions and zero-hit replacements keep
their no-op behavior; the stale-revision check (409) runs first.

A session can be **archived** (``archive_session``,
``POST /sessions/{id}/archive``) once its offline edits are final.  The
seal re-reads the record and checks ``expected_revision`` inside the
same cross-process locked section as commits, computes the ordinary
merge result (document, version, conflicts, tombstones) and persists
that result together with the ``archived`` flag in one atomic write.
Archiving adds no operation, no revision and no history boundary, so it
produces no change-event revision and existing cursors keep working;
``GET /sessions/{id}`` shows ``archived`` and serves the frozen result.
Sealing an already-archived session at its current revision is
idempotent (the stored result is returned verbatim); a stale revision
conflicts.  After a successful seal every batch and JSONPath
replacement -- including exact retransmissions and zero-hit queries,
and before any validation -- is rejected with
``SessionArchivedError`` (HTTP 409) without touching the document, log
or history.  If another process commits first, a stale seal gets the
409; if the seal lands first, the other process's write gets the 409.
Records written before archiving existed read the flag as false.

Sessions are persisted as one JSON file per session inside a directory
(``SESSION_STORE_DIR`` env var, default ``.sessions``), so they remain
readable after the service (or ``docker compose``) restarts.  The lock
files are never deleted -- they are tiny, their number is bounded by the
number of sessions, and deleting them would reintroduce an
unlink/reopen race.
